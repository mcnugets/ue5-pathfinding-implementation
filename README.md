<h1 align="center" color="D5FF00">  UNREAL ENGINE 5 PATHFINDING IMPLEMENTATION </h1>
 <h4 align="center">Project is a replica of <a href="https://github.com/mcnugets/unity-pathfinding-methods.git">this</a> idea, but improved and implemented in UE5. Mainly A* and Dijkstra's.</h4>

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



<p align = "justify"> This project includes a number of basic functions of ai pathfinding Algorithms These methods are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijktra algorithm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"> A star algorithm</a>. The basic pathfinding algorithms were implemented to provide the foundation for further game development. For this reason, the current project involves several implemented function that helps Agent(AI) to operate accordingly within the game. The whole purpose is to create customized, and truly "smart" in-game characters.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://github.com/mcnugets/unity-pathfinding-methods.git">this</a> project, a few more elements have been added to the logic:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Procedural generative grid. This works via setting the barriers and the cell generation works accordingly, however possible undefined behavior may occur if the barrier is not properly. </strong> </li>
<li><strong>Procedural generative spawn points/Smart Pathfinding</strong></li>
</ul>	

<p>Note: I am still thinking about how to implement this Algorithm, the best. Possibly I might involve some reinforcement learning, but some aspects need to be considered, like performance. </p>
